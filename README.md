# Attempt-to-benchmark-warehouse-logistics

This repository provides a modular and open-source simulation framework for evaluating warehouse layouts and routing strategies under standardized conditions. It was developed to support reproducible benchmarking in warehouse logistics by separating experimental logic from scenario-specific contributions.

## 🔍 Motivation

Research on warehouse optimization is often hampered by proprietary tools, non-reproducible environments, and undocumented assumptions. This project addresses these issues by providing a transparent, extensible, and community-oriented framework. It enables researchers to systematically develop, execute, and compare warehouse picking strategies within clearly defined environments.

## 🧩 System Architecture

The framework is composed of three interoperable modules:

- **Module 1 – Layout Design Tool**  
  A web-based GUI for defining warehouse topologies, including aisle structures, storage areas, and picker positions.

- **Module 2 – Simulation Core**  
  A Python-based engine that loads defined layouts and scenarios, executes multi-agent simulations, and outputs detailed trajectories and KPIs.

- **Module 3 – Visualization Module**  
  An interactive web interface to visualize picker movements and compare routing strategies qualitatively.

User contributions include layouts (`.json`), scenario definitions (`.pkl`), and routing algorithms (`.py`). These are processed by the framework to generate simulation traces (`.json`) and aggregated performance results (`.txt`).
