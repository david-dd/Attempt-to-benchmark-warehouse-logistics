However, it is also possible to create your own benchmark for a layout defined by you.
- To do this, create a layout within the web interface using module 1. 
- Finally, export the layout and save it in the "_layouts" directory. 
- Edit the file: "gen_EvalDataset.py"
- Enter the name of your layout in the variable "Warehouse_Architectures".

- Execute the file "gen_EvalDataset.py". Usually 1000 episodes are created.
